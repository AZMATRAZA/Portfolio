    description: "Hi, I'm Md Azmat Raza, a passionate software developer with experience in designing and developing innovative applications. I hold a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from Maulana Azad National Urdu University, where I graduated with a commendable academic record.

Throughout my career, I have gained valuable expertise in various programming languages, including C, C++, Java, and JavaScript. I am skilled in utilizing frameworks like Springboot and Hibernate, as well as developing microservices. My proficiency extends to tools and platforms such as BIT-Bucket, Jira, and GitHub, allowing me to collaborate effectively and deliver high-quality code.

During my time at Foraysoft Pvt Ltd., where I was deployed at TCS, I contributed to the development of Ericsson Network Management (ENM), a comprehensive telecom network management system. I played a key role in releasing ENM to customers every three weeks, ensuring its operational support for 3G, LTE, 4G, and 5G networks.

At Zawsoft Web Solutions, I actively participated in the development of interactive web applications using Java and employed my expertise in system design and architecture. I successfully enhanced the user interface and streamlined the service request process of an internal server request tool.

In addition to my professional experience, I have worked on several projects, including a Hospital Management System implemented using Java and MySQL. This B2B product utilized a SAAS platform and featured separate modules for departments such as Pharmacy, Patient Registration, and CSSD. I also contributed to an event-based project, where I was involved in project setup, database design, and documentation, collaborating closely with project consultants.

Another noteworthy project I worked on was a File Sharing App, which enabled secure file sharing with email authentication and user validation. I was responsible for developing the web application and implementing robust data management using Java and MySQL.

With a passion for continuous learning, I stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies. I am a self-motivated and detail-oriented individual, dedicated to delivering efficient and reliable software solutions.",
